            <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>My research interests lie in (1) Heat transfer and fluid mechanics, particularly in granular systems (2) Mechanics of granular media and (3) Phase field modelling. I've worked (and am working on) on a number of projects in these areas, as mentioned below. Feel free to contact me if you want more information or have intresting ideas to share.</p>

            <h3>Heat Transfer in a Granular Medium</h3>
            <h4>Advisor: Prof Ratna Kumar Annabattula</h4>
                <p>Granular assemblies are found in plenty, both in nature and in the industry. In fact, they are the second most common 'phase' handled in industries (after water)! This makes understanding their behaviour and rheology absolutely imperative. I was introduced to granular media by Prof. Ratna Kumar at the beginning of my 3rd year, somewhere around August 2015. Initially, I studied the structure of a packed bed of monodisperse pebbles when poured into a container, with the help of a Discrete Element Method (DEM) engine called LIGGGHTS. Soon, my interest in heat transfer led me to investigate heat transfer in a packed bed. While simulating (effective) one dimensional conduction through a packed bed, I was surprised to see that it behaved exactly like a solid rod, albeit with a different thermal conductivity. Batchelor and O'Brien had performed an analysis on the effective thermal conductivity of a packed bed, and had come up with an expression for an isotropic system. I theoretically derived a similar expression for relating the effective thermal conductivity to various parameters that characterized the random arrangement, such as packing fraction, contact radius, coordination number etc. It was truly satisfying to see my formula work and yield very good matches with simulation. I will be presenting my work  at the Second International Conference on Powders, Granules and Bulk Solids, which is going to be held between December 1st to 3rd 2016, in Jaipur, India.</p>

            <h3>Dendritic Growth of Poly-Ethylene Oxide (PEO) on a 2D Mesoscale Lattice</h3>
            <h4>Advisor: Prof Manu Jaiswal</h4>
                <p>I started working on this project by accident! My physics professor, Prof Manu Jaiswal, told us in class that he had obtained interesting dendritic growth patterns of PEO on a 2D mesoscale lattice. When he shared the images with us, I was fascinated by the complexity of the patterns, and decided that I would work on figuring out how they occured. I spent the first couple of months building probabilistic growth models, for which I wrote codes in MATLAB. Every time, refinements were made to the model to get closer matches with experiment. It took about five iterations to get a very good match. However, the models got increasingly complex and had several unphysical constraints. I was motivated to find a simpler physical explanation for the whole phenomenon. Since this was a completely new area, it was very hard to make progress because I didn't know where to start. After some discussions with Prof Jaiswal and a few weeks of thinking, I figured out that the whole phenomenon could be explained using the theory of phase transistions. I numerically modelled the whole phenomenon using phase field modeling (my internship at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology really helped me with that) and obtained growth patterns which reproduced the experimental results. I learnt a lot from this project, mainly because it was in a completely different area.</p>

            <h3>Heat Transfer Studies in Rotating Heat Sinks</h3>
            <h4>Advisor: Prof Chakravarthy Balaji</h4>
                <p>I'm currently working on my Bachelor thesis titled 'Heat Transfer and Optimization Studies using Rotating Heat Sinks'. This project is of interest to me because of the potential industrial applications it has, such as in electronic cooling. The aim is to determine the increase in cooling rate achieved by rotating a cylindrical heat sink, and also find the optimal placement of fins inside the heat sink. So far, I've numerically simulated rotation of the heat sink and determined that convection (induced by rotation) produces an increased cooling rate. </p>

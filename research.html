            <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>My research interests lie in (1) Heat transfer and fluid mechanics, particularly in granular systems (2) Mechanics of granular media and (3) Phase field modelling. I've worked (and am working on) on a number of projects in these areas, as mentioned below. Feel free to contact me if you want more information or have interesting ideas to share.</p>

            <h3>Heat Transfer in a Granular Medium</h3>
            <h4>Advisor: Prof Ratna Kumar Annabattula</h4>

                <p>Granular assemblies are found in plenty, both in nature and in the industry. In fact, they are the second most common 'phase' handled in industries (after water)! This makes understanding their behaviour and rheology absolutely imperative. I was introduced to granular media by Prof. Ratna Kumar at the beginning of my 3rd year, somewhere around August 2015. Initially, I studied the structure of a packed bed of monodisperse pebbles when poured into a container, with the help of a Discrete Element Method (DEM) engine called LIGGGHTS. Soon, my interest in heat transfer led me to investigate heat transfer in a packed bed. While simulating (effective) one dimensional conduction through a packed bed, I was surprised to see that it behaved exactly like a solid rod, albeit with a different thermal conductivity. Batchelor and O'Brien (1977) had performed an analysis on the effective thermal conductivity of a packed bed, and had come up with an expression for an isotropic system. I theoretically derived a similar expression for relating the effective thermal conductivity to various parameters that characterized the random arrangement, such as packing fraction, contact radius, coordination number etc. It was very satisfying to see my formula work and yield very good matches with simulation. I presented my work  at the Second International Conference on Powder, Granule and Bulk Solids on December 3rd, 2016, in Jaipur, India. I extended my work to a general polydisperse system, and my efforts led to a paper submission to the International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer in December 2016 (the paper is currently under review).</p>

            <h3>Dendritic Growth of Poly-Ethylene Oxide (PEO) on a 2D Mesoscale Lattice</h3>
            <h4>Advisor: Prof Manu Jaiswal</h4>
            <image src="research_fig2.png" width="500" height="500">
                <p>My physics professor, Prof Manu Jaiswal, told us in class that he had obtained interesting dendritic growth patterns of PEO on a 2D mesoscale lattice. I was fascinated by the patterns, and the interest I developed in simplifying complex systems while working on granular materials led to work on this project. I spent the first couple of months building probabilistic growth models, for which I wrote codes in MATLAB. Every time, refinements were made to the model to get closer matches with experiment. It took about five iterations to get a very good match. However, the models got increasingly complex and had several unphysical constraints. I was motivated to find a simpler physical explanation for the whole phenomenon. Since this was a completely new area, it was very hard to make progress because I didn't know where to start. After some discussions with Prof Jaiswal and a few weeks of thinking, I figured out that the whole phenomenon could be explained using the theory of phase transistions. I numerically modelled the whole phenomenon using phase field modeling (my internship at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology really helped me with that) and obtained growth patterns which reproduced the experimental results. I learnt a lot from this project, mainly because it was in a completely different area.</p>

            <h3>Heat Transfer Studies in Rotating Heat Sinks</h3>
            <h4>Advisor: Prof Chakravarthy Balaji</h4>
            <image src="research_fig3.png" width="700" height="400">
                <p>I'm currently working on my Bachelor thesis titled 'Heat Transfer and Optimization Studies using Rotating Heat Sinks'. This project is of interest to me because of the potential industrial applications it has, such as in electronic cooling. The aim is to determine the increase in cooling rate achieved by rotating a cylindrical heat sink, and also find the optimal placement of fins inside the heat sink. So far, I've numerically simulated rotation of the heat sink and determined that convection (induced by rotation) produces an increased cooling rate. I am currently working on optimizing the placement of fins inside the heat sink by using neural networks.</p>

            <h3>Phase Field Modelling</h3>
            <h4>Advisor: Prof Britta Nestler</h4>
            <image src="research_fig5.png"  width="250" height="250"> <image src="research_fig4.png"  width="500" height="250">
                <p>I spent the summer of 2016 at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology as a DAAD WISE scholar, working under Prof. Britta Nestler on phasef field modeling. I learnt various formulations of phase field modeling and how they can be applied to a wide variety of physical systems. I also analyzed the behaviour of a triple junction, under static conditions (by measuring the equilibrium angle) and dynamic conditions (by measuring the interfacial velocity) under various phase field formulations using the PACE3D package, an in-house package developed at KIT. I also verified Youngâ€™s law at the triple junction for a new simplex formulation constructed by Prof. Nestler's group</p>

            <h3>Mechanics of Granular Media</h3>  
            <div>
                <p style="float: left;"><image src="research_fig6.png" width="250"></p>
                <p> <br/><br/>Over the last few months, I have developed interest in the mechanics of granular systems. Of particular interest to me is the continuum modeling of granular flows starting from fundamental interparticle models. I am interested in developing constitutive equations for various flows and correlating microscopic parameters with the flow dynamics. I'm also looking at statistical models of granular assemblies, most notably the model by Sam F Edwards.</p>

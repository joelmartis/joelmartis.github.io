            <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>My research interests lie in (1) Heat transfer and fluid mechanics, particularly in granular systems (2) Physics of granular media and (3) Phase field modelling. I've worked (and am working on) on a number of projects in these areas, as mentioned below. Feel free to contact me if you want more information or have intresting ideas to share.</p>

            <h3>Heat Transfer in a Granular Medium</h3>
                <p>Granular assemblies are found in plenty, both in nature and in the industry. In fact, they are the second most common 'phase' handled in industries (after water)! This makes understanding their behaviour and rheology absolutely imperative. I was introduced to granular media by Prof. Ratna Kumar at the beginning of my 3rd year, somewhere around August 2015. Initially, I studied the structure of a packed bed of monodisperse pebbles when poured into a container, with the help of a Discrete Element Method (DEM) engine called LIGGGHTS. Soon, my interest in heat transfer led me to investigate heat transfer in a packed bed. While simulating (effective) one dimensional conduction through a packed bed, I was surprised to see that it behaved exactly like a solid rod, albeit with a different thermal conductivity. Batchelor and O'Brien had performed an analysis on the effective thermal conductivity of a packed bed, and had come up with an expression for an isotropic system. I theoretically derived a similar expression for relating the effective thermal conductivity to various parameters that characterized the random arrangement, such as packing fraction, contact radius, coordination number etc. It was truly satisfying to see my formula work and yield very good matches with simulation. I will be presenting my work  at the Second International Conference on Powders, Granules and Bulk Solids, which is going to be held between December 1st to 3rd 2016, in Jaipur, India.</p>

            <h3>Dendritic Growth of Poly-Ethylene Oxide (PEO) on a 2D Mesoscale Lattice</h3>
                <p>In December 2013, my physics professor, Dr Manu Jaiswal, told us (his class) that he had obtained interesting dendritic growth patterns of PEO on a 2D mesoscale lattice. When he shared the images with us, I was fascinated by the complexity of the patterns, and decided that I would work on figuring out how they occured. I spent the first couple of months building probabilistic growth models, for which I wrote codes in MATLAB. Every time, refinements were made to the model to get closer matches with experiment. It took about five iterations to get a very good experimental match. However, I did not want to stop there. The bigger goal was to explain the whole phenomenon using physics. I wanted one equation to explain the entire growth pattern. Since this was a completely different problem, I was in a fix.</p>
